<h1>Sara's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>The Best Movie's I've ever Seen!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Fievel: An American Tail</h3>
<p>I loved this movie growing up. My favorite song growing up was "Somewhere Out There."</p>
<h3>Mad Love</h3>
<p>A story of a woman suffering from manic depression (1990's Drew Barrymore) who captures the attention of her lakeside
    neighbor (Chris Odonnel). She convinces him to sweep her away to Mexico. It's a dramatic 90s teen romance movie.
    Worth a watch. I haven't seen it in forever, so maybe I should rewatch to ensure I still like it.</p>
<h3>Big Fish</h3>
<p>Ewen McGreggor has my heart forever, and the visuals of this film directed by Tim Burton are captivating</p>
